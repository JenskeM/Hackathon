                  The first time I saw Zotte Lotte, she was entertaining on a
                  wedding. I had a great time. Therefore I asked my mommy and
                  daddy if she could come to my birthday party. And they said
                  yes! We did a lot of great games and we also baked cookies.
                  They were all gone before the party ended. Now all my friends
                  want to have Zotte Lotte on their birthday party!

                  I had the princess-themed party. It was really amazing. Me and
                  my friends were dressed beautifully. Zotte Lotte even had a
                  pirate costume for my little brother. The only bad thing was
                  that I didn't won the game. I don't like losing, therefore one
                  star less.
