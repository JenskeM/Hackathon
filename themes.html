              Zotte Lotte has a various of theme parties ready to go!
              <br />She has made a difference between the parties for children
              <a href="#themes1">from 4 until 7 </a> and
              <a href="#themes2">from 8 until 12</a> years old. She already
              prepared these parties especially for you. At the time of the
              party, Zotte Lotte loves to be present when the gifts are given
              (and maybe get something tasty as well). Afterwards she will start
              her program. You don't have to prepare anything: Zotte Lotte takes
              care of all of it! So your caretakers can just sit back and relax.
              Zotte Lotte will attend the party for 3 hours (whatever themed
              party it is). <br />So which party will it be?

                  <p>
                    Are you brave and completely fearless? Aren't you afraid of
                    water? And can you set up a great '<b>ARGH</b>'? Yes?
                    <br />Then you have found the treasury with this party!
                    <br />During this party Zotte Lotte is going to test if you
                    can be a real pirate. She herself dares everything, but does
                    the same counts for you? Do you dare to become a real
                    pirate?
                    <br />
                    Then yell: <b>AYE AYE, CAPTAIN</b>!

                    Is pink your favorite color? Do you like to wear a pretty
                    dress? But most important: do you dream to be a princess?
                    With this party your dream will come true! You and your
                    friends get a complete make-over and become true princesses
                    (or princes if you prefer). You don't need a fairy godmother
                    to have your own amazing <b>FAIRY TALE</b>. Your party will
                    definitely have a happy ending.

                    <br />
                    She prefer to eat at least 10 cookies a day. Especially when
                    they are made herself... Hmm when they are so fresh and
                    warm. <b>DELICIOUS!</b>
                    You can bake these amazing cookies as well, together with
                    Zotte Lotte and your friends. Of course, all these cookies
                    must me tasted as well and Zotte Lotte can eat a lot, but
                    not THAT much. So you and your friends have to help Zotte
                    Lotte with tasting them. But are you all truly bakers? That
                    we have to test of course as well.

                    Is a farm your favorite spot? And aren't you afraid to
                    become a bit dirty? (Don't let your parents read that...)
                    <br />
                    In this party you will visit a <b>REAL FARM</b>. On a farm
                    is of course pretty big, so enough space to enjoy a lot of
                    different games with your friends. But what is the most fun
                    part of a farm? Exactly, the animals! So to make your party
                    even more awesome, you and your friends may help the farmer
                    with feeding the cows! <b>How fun is that?!</b> So put on
                    your boots and get ready to become a farmer for a day.

                    a dream comes true when becoming a circus artist! Not only
                    will there be magicians, but acrobats and clowns as well.
                    There will be even more circus artists! But what is a circus
                    without a circus director? No, that's not really possible.
                    So of course, a circus director will present the entire
                    show! Zotte Lotte herself will be behind the camera. So you
                    can review your amazing show as much as you want with all of
                    your friends and family. It will be <b>magical</b>!

                    want to not only become a superhero on the inside, but on
                    the outside as well? Zotte Lotte can make that possible!
                    What is a superhero without his mask or cape? Together you
                    will create your own! But of course, a superhero has to have
                    some qualities. Therefore it will be tested if you are a
                    good superhero or not. But those tests will be very easy for
                    you right? Or will those tests be like kryptonite for you?

                    On social media you see a lot of video clips. In most of
                    them a real celebrity is present as the star. But what if

                    right?! Together with your friends you will make a lipdub
                    and all of you will be real stars! Of course, not everybody
                    who likes video clips likes to be in the spotlight as well.
                    If that sounds like you, then the role of director will be

                    Zotte Lotte loves to just lay in bed and watch YouTube
                    video's all day. Does that sounds familiar? Wouldn't it be
                    fun to be in a video yourself? Hopefully you aren't afraid
                    of the camera, want you will be the one who's vlogging this
                    time! During the vlog-party you and your friends have to
                    execute a various amount of challenges. Zotte Lotte will
                    film these challenges. So you and your friends can review
                    your own vlog-video's as often as you want (and of course
                    while you're in bed). So, put on a pretty smile and the
                    video will be definitely amazing with you as the
                    <b>STAR</b>!
